# DMR QRZ
DMR QRZ mobile friendly search for DMR ID or callsign

Typically when walking the dog with my DMR radio, I'll want to look up a DMR ID or callsign but it involves multiple clicks, scrolls, zooms - just making it a little more difficult that it should be while I'm out and about.

The solution was a simple 1-page site where I can lookup a DMR ID or callsign and see the person's info from the DMR database, along with a country flag and a profile picture if available, and link on the callsign to their QRZ page, and link on their DMRID to their RadioID page

I'm hoping for feedback from mobile phone users.
